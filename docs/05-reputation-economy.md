# 5. Reputation economy

Reputation is the backbone of GBlock. It replaces money as the thing that
unlocks access, and it is the mechanism that keeps the network honest. This
page explains how reputation is measured, how it grows, and what it unlocks.

## The two units: Volume and Power

GBlock reputation has two units. They do different things and you need to
understand both.

### Volume

**Volume is your long-term reputation.**

- It is an **append-only ledger**: it only grows, it never resets, and it is
  never spent on productive actions.
- Volume determines your **Reputation Tier**, which sets your reward rate and
  your Power recharge speed.
- Volume is earned through responsible conduct: successful guarantees,
  well-maintained blocks, contributions to the network, and (where applicable)
  referral outcomes.
- The single most important rule: **you cannot buy Volume.** It is only earned.

### Power

**Power is your operational capacity.**

- Power is what you spend to take productive actions that grow the network:
  sending invitations and issuing guarantees.
- Each invitation reserves 10 Power. Each guarantee reserves 10 Power.
- Reserved Power returns when the invitation activates or expires, or when the
  guarantee's probation completes.
- Your Power ceiling is `power_max = max(Volume, status_floor)`. This means
  earning Volume raises your Power ceiling, and so does qualifying for a higher
  status.

Think of it this way: Volume is your track record, Power is the working budget
that track record lets you deploy.

## The Canonical Tier Catalog

Reputation Tier is derived from Volume. The canonical catalog
(`tier-catalog-2026-07-v1`) is:

| Tier | Volume range | Reward rate | Power recharge time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Verified** | 0 - 49 | 10% | 168 hours |
| **Core** | 50 - 149 | 13% | 120 hours |
| **Principal** | 150 - 349 | 17% | 72 hours |
| **Partner** | 350 - 749 | 20% | 24 hours |
| **Vanguard** | 750+ | 25% | 12 hours |

The ladder has no ceiling: Vanguard starts at 750 Volume and 25% is the
maximum direct reward rate. The recharge times double as the reputation
recovery cooldown after a penalty or a reworked vouch (168/120/72/24/12 hours
by tier).

### How to read the catalog

- **Reward rate** is the share of confirmed non-transactional TECH HY revenue
  allocated to the member when a rewardable event occurs. Higher tiers earn a
  larger share. Rewards are never paid from transaction volume, because GBlock
  does not settle transactions.
- **Power recharge time** is how long it takes a unit of spent Power to return.
  At Verified tier, a unit takes a week to recharge; at Vanguard, half a day.
  Higher tiers can invite and guarantee far more often.

### The two "Verified" labels

Be careful with the word _Verified_:

- A **Verified Trust Tier** means you passed KYC (identity assurance).
- A **Verified Reputation Tier** means you have 0-49 Volume (you are at the
  start of your reputation journey).

They are independent. A KYC-verified member with little activity is Verified
trust tier and Verified reputation tier. A long-tenured anonymous member could
be Vanguard reputation tier while still Anonymous trust tier. Always check the
context.

## How Power is spent and returned

Two productive actions reserve Power.

### Invitations

- You reserve **10 Power** when you send an invitation.
- The Power returns when the invitation **activates** (the recipient onboards)
  or **expires** (they never used the magic link).
- If the invitee misbehaves, you may face reputation impact beyond the Power
  reserve. This is why you should only invite people you can stand behind.

### Guarantees

- You reserve **10 Power** when you accept a guarantee request.
- The Power returns when the ward's **probation completes** successfully.
- If the ward violates trust during probation, both of you are penalized.
  Three or more violations lead to revocation of the guarantee.

Because Power is reserved (not destroyed), taking a productive action does not
permanently shrink your capacity. It temporarily lowers your available Power
until the action resolves. As you climb tiers, Power recharges faster, so your
effective throughput grows.

## Vouches

Vouches are the second backing instrument. They are how waitlist candidates
reach **Resident** status, and they move real reputation.

### How vouching works

- Vouching for a member credits **+10 reputation to them** and **+5 to you**.
- Creating a vouch stakes **10 of your Volume capacity**. Net of your +5
  reward, a vouch costs you 5 net capacity — vouches are never free.
- Your vouch limit is derived from your Volume: **your Volume capacity divided
  by ten, rounded down**. There are no separate per-tier caps. When your
  capacity is low, you have fewer vouches to give.
- The first vouch of a waitlist candidate can come from **any KYC-approved
  member**; the decisive second vouch — the one that completes Resident
  status — must come from a **KYC-verified Resident**.

### If a vouch goes wrong

A vouch can be reworked (withdrawn because the vouched member violated
trust):

- The staked Volume capacity is **not** returned.
- The vouched member's gained reputation is clawed back, plus an extra 1-point
  penalty for the voucher.
- Negative reputation events of the member you vouched for propagate to you at
  **50%** while your vouch is active.
- Two or more reworks in a rolling 30 days put your vouching on hold and queue
  the case for operator review.

The rules are deliberately asymmetric: vouching earns modestly, but backing
the wrong person costs you real reputation.

## Reward rates and the referral ladder

The reward rate from the tier catalog is the **direct** (first-level) share of
confirmed non-transactional TECH HY revenue allocated to you when a
rewardable event occurs — a scoring purchase, development or consulting work,
or any other sale attributable to your referral.

On top of the direct ladder:

- **Multi-level overrides:** 6% for second-level referrals, 3% for third-level,
  1% for fourth-level (for members with KYC).
- **Top-leaders pool:** 5% of rewardable revenue is pooled and distributed
  monthly among the top ambassadors.
- **Top-ambassador bonus:** the leading ambassador of each month receives an
  additional bonus.

Rewards are never paid from transaction volume, because GBlock does not settle
transactions. A 5% reserve is held back for refunds and compensations; this is
an internal accounting figure, not a member-facing number.

### How rewards reach you

- Reward accruals are credited to your **reward balance** in a monthly batch
  on the **1st of the month**.
- There is no self-service withdrawal: moving rewards off-platform happens
  through a reviewed **payout request** (minimum $50, USDT BEP-20; without KYC
  a single request is capped at $150). See
  [Payouts and rewards](10-payouts-and-rewards.md).
- You can move rewards into your payment balance yourself (a 3% fee applies);
  moving payment balance back into rewards is an operator-reviewed request.
- Balances are reconciled daily against the reward ledger; any discrepancy
  alerts the operator before anything is paid out.

## How Volume grows

Volume is an append-only ledger of positive contributions. The exact accrual
events are governed by operator policy, but the categories are stable:

- **Successful guarantees.** When a ward completes probation in good standing,
  the guarantor may receive a Volume bonus.
- **Well-maintained blocks.** Active, fresh, accurately described blocks
  contribute to seller reputation.
- **Referral outcomes.** When an invitee contributes positively to the network,
  the inviter's referral attribution can translate into Volume.
- **Sustained good conduct.** Long-term participation without violations is
  recognized.

Your accrual rate is multiplied by your Trust Tier and 2FA status:

| Trust Tier | Base rate | With 2FA |
|---|---|---|
| Anonymous | 1.0x | 1.1x |
| Vouched | 1.0x | 1.1x |
| Verified | 1.2x | **1.3x** |

This is why KYC matters even for reputation growth. A Verified member earns
reputation 20% faster than an Anonymous member at the same level of activity,
and 30% faster with 2FA enabled.

## What reputation unlocks

Reputation is not a vanity score. It translates directly into capability.

| Capability | Driver |
|---|---|
| Higher reward rate on non-transactional revenue | Reputation Tier |
| Faster Power recharge, so more invites and guarantees per period | Reputation Tier |
| More vouches you can give (capacity divided by ten) | Volume (Reputation Tier) |
| Shorter operator review SLA | Trust Tier (Verified at 24h, Vouched at 48h, Anonymous at 72h) |
| Higher reputation accrual rate | Trust Tier + 2FA |
| Eligibility to act as guarantor on the Vouched path | Trust Tier (Verified only) |
| Ability to place sale blocks without a guarantor | Trust Tier (Verified only) |
| Primary-market listing eligibility | Trust Tier (Verified) + KYB + project KYC |
| Higher simultaneous active block limit | Trust Tier (0 / 1 / 3) |

Notice that some capabilities are driven by **Trust Tier** (identity assurance)
and others by **Reputation Tier** (accumulated conduct). They work together.
A Verified member with Vanguard-tier Volume has the best of both: full market
access, the highest reward rate, the fastest recharge, and the shortest SLA.

## Common misconceptions

**"I can pay to skip tiers."**
No. Volume cannot be purchased. The only way to climb tiers is to accumulate
reputation through conduct over time.

**"Power is spent and gone."**
No. Power is reserved for the duration of an action and returns when the action
resolves. Your ceiling grows with Volume and status.

**"A higher Reputation Tier lets me place blocks."**
Not by itself. Block placement is gated by **Trust Tier** (Vouched or
Verified), not Reputation Tier. A Vanguard-tier Anonymous member still cannot
place a block.

**"Rewards come from deal volume."**
No. GBlock does not settle transactions. Rewards are paid only from confirmed
non-transactional TECH HY revenue.

**"I can withdraw my rewards whenever I want."**
No. There is no self-service withdrawal. Rewards are paid out through a
reviewed payout request with a $50 minimum (and a $150 per-request cap without
KYC). See [Payouts and rewards](10-payouts-and-rewards.md).

**"Vouching is free reputation."**
No. A vouch stakes your Volume capacity, is limited by that capacity, and a
reworked vouch costs you the stake plus a penalty.
